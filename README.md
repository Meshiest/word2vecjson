Word2Vec JSON
==================

[Word2vec](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/) represents words as vectors whose components encompass what the words mean. Algebraic operations on those vectors, like "king" - "man" + "woman", yield intuitively correct results, like "queen". This project provides the word vectors for the 10000 common English words in JSON.
